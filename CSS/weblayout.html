            <h2>Information of galaxy</h2>
            <p>
                A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by
                gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to
                the
                Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3]
                range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known –
                supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the
                mass
                in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the
                form
                of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.

                Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6]
                Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole,
                known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[7] As of March 2016, GN-z11
                is
                the oldest and most distant galaxy observed. It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from
                Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.

                In 2016, using 20 years of images from the Hubble space telescope, it was estimated that there were in
                total
                two trillion (2×1012)[8] or more[9][10] galaxies in the observable universe, and as many as an estimated
                1×1024 stars[11][12] (more stars than all the grains of sand on all beaches of the planet Earth).[13]

                In 2021, data from NASA's New Horizons space probe was used to revise the earlier estimate to roughly
                200
                billion galaxies (2×1011),[14]

                Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and
                are
                separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky
                Way
                has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy (with
                diameter of about 152,000 ly), its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)

                The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average
                density
                of less than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters
                and
                superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy.
                The
                group is part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged
                into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids.[15] Both the Local Group and the Virgo
                Supercluster
                are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.

            <h2>About sun</h2>
            <img class="photo1" src="/sun.jpg" alt="" height="500px" width="500px">
            <p>
                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot
                plasma,[18][19]
                heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as
                light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on
                Earth.

                The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is
                about
                330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly
                three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with
                much
                smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[21]

                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately,
                referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). It formed approximately 4.6
                billion[a][14][22]
                years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of
                this
                matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar
                System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its
                core. It
                is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
