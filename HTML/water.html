            <mark>Climate change</mark> will also impact freshwater supply. Global warming is resulting in shifting
            <b>rainfall patterns</b>, an increase in the number of <em>dry days</em>, torrential rainfall over short
            periods of time, and extreme weather events, all of which increase the likelihood of droughts and floods.
            It, in turn, will affect food supplies and human health. Water is expected to be a major source of conflict
            in future because demand is soaring and <ins>freshwater reserves are severely stressed.</ins> Plummeting
            groundwater resources in many regions and inefficient use of water is a matter of serious concern.

            saving techniques can save you money and diverts less water from our <i>rivers, bays, and estuaries,</i>
            which helps keep the <mark>environment healthy.</mark> as we all know, is a vital resource for the existence
            of <b>life on earth.</b> Though its supply seems abundant, the percentage of available freshwater is even
            less.<b><ins><mark>Global warming</mark></ins></b> and <ins><b><mark>constant climate</mark></b></ins>
            change have led to delayed rains, causing water scarcity. An increase in population, the rapid development
            of industries and polluted water bodies have further worsened the issue. Without proper conservation
            efforts, the chances are that we might exhaust it. Saving water has economic and social benefits. Besides,
            protecting water resources for future efficient use reduces wastage and contributes to energy-efficient
            operations.
