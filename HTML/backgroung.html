        Yadav would often say “Nitish Kumar cannot stay in an alliance for a long time”. He claimed to have introduced Nitish Kumar to socialist leader and former CM Karpoori Thakur.
        Yadav was the bridge between Bihar and national politics for a long time, and between the state’s two top leaders. He was also the one who got the Samata Party of George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar to merge with his Janata Dal (U), making it a bigger political identity and eventually a partner of the BJP after the 2005 Bihar Assembly elections.
        His entry into national politics too was dramatic. In 1974, the JP movement against the Indira Gandhi government had started spreading, and was taking the Hindi heartland by storm. The Congress MP from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh died suddenly and Jayaprakash Narayan decided to field a young college student as the joint Opposition candidate to take on the then mighty Congress in the bye-elections.
        The 27-year-old created history by trouncing the formidable Congress– and humbling Indira. He never looked back thereafter.
        Over the next five decades , he emerged as one of the champions of socialist and backward politics who maintained relations with leaders across the political spectrum.
