        <p>This article is about the
            <b>Indian</b> socialist revolutionary.
            One of Jefferis' <strong>earliest ideas</strong> was a type of mine that could be towed behind a rowboat,
            which would attach itself to the hull of a ship that it passed.
            Getting a heavy bomb to stick to a <i>ship reliably</i> was a problem.
            The obvious <em>answer was to use magnets</em>, which should be as powerful as possible.
            The first<mark> versions</mark> were assembled in a few weeks.
            A smaller version named <small>"Clam"</small> was developed from the <del>British limpet</del> for use on
            land.

                While searching for videos of a different singer, <q><b>Scooter Braun</b></q>, a former marketing
                executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.[30]
                Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing at, located Bieber's school, and finally
                contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism.
