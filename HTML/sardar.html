        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from
            other lawyers, passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife <b>Jhaverba</b> from her
            parents' home, Patel set up his household in <ins><em>Godhra</em></ins> and was called to the bar. During
            the many years it took him to save money, Patel now an advocate earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled
            <q>lawyer</q>. The couple had a daughter, <mark>Maniben</mark>, in <strong>1903</strong> and a son,
            <mark>Dahyabhai</mark>, in <strong>1905</strong>. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from the
            <ins>Bubonic plague</ins> when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he
            immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other
            accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple). there, he recovered slowly.</p>
