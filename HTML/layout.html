The people of Saurashtra of Western Gujarat have moved away from their rain-starved native to Surat in search for income generation and survival almost four decades ago. Since then Saurashtrians have considered Surat as their home land.  After coming to Surat, some individuals began trading business while majority of them entered into labour front in a phased manner.
